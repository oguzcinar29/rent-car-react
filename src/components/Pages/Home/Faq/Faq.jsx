              Book in advance: Booking your rental car ahead of time can often
              result in lower prices. Compare prices from multiple companies:
              Use websites like Kayak, Expedia, or Travelocity to compare prices
              from multiple rental car companies. Look for discount codes and
              coupons: Search for discount codes and coupons that you can use to
              lower the rental price. Renting from an off-airport location can
              sometimes result in lower prices.
